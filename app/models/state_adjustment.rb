# Manual and arbitrary adjustment in the state of a state machine (a request,
# reimbursement, etc.) ignoring the transitions definitions in the state
# machine. Saving the StateAdjustment to the database will update the associated
# state machine automatically.
#
# StateAdjustment objects should only be used in situations in which
# StateTransition is not applicable. In order to keep the information as sane
# as possible, state transitions are cleary encouraged instead of state
# adjustments, since the former follows the the state machine specification and
# the later can break the expected workflow.
