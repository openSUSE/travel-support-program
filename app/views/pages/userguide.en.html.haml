%h2 About the application

%p
  The goal of this web based application is to offer a convenient way of managing
  the requests from travel sponsorship and marketing materials programs of free
  software organizations. Although been developed initially for managing the
  openSUSE Travel Support Program and the shipment of openSUSE's booth boxes,
  the workflow of requests and reimbursements can be changed to fulfill the needs
  of any organization. This document shows workflow diagrams automatically
  generated from the current configuration.


%h2 Personal information

%p
  First of all, people responsible of the materials and the money need to
  know who are supporting, so make sure that the personal information in
  - if user_signed_in?
    = link_to "your profile", profile_path
  - else
    your profile
  is up to date. Logged users can reach their profile by clicking in the
  corresponding option in the main menu or in their own username at the
  top right corner of the page, next to the &#39;log out&#39; link.

- if enabled? :opensuse_connect
  Some of the information in the profile cannot be entered directly in the
  application. That information is read from
  = link_to "openSUSE Connect", TravelSupport::Config.setting(:opensuse_connect, :base_url)
  and should be updated in the Connect profile of the user.

%p
  The whole process happens in the context of an event. In the
  =link_to "events list", events_path
  you can see events accepting requests.
  Depending of the permissions configuration, you will be able to create new
  events or only to apply to previously existing events.
  For each event, in the &#39;ask for&#39; column there can be one or several
  buttons, depending on the event itself and the system configuration,
  allowing to create new requests in the system.

- links = []
- if enabled? :travel_sponsorships
  - links << link_to("travel support requests", travel_sponsorships_path)
- if enabled? :shipments
  - links << link_to("shipment requests", shipments_path)
%p
  You can save the request at any moment and edit it later. It will be always
  available in your
  = links.join(" or ").html_safe
  list.
  One important note: creating, editing or saving your request DOES NOT send it to the
  people in charge of taking the final decision. As long as the request state is
  &#39;incomplete&#39;, it will be under your own control until you decide to change
  the state by using one of the options in the &#39;action&#39; dropdown button.

%p
  Understanding the &#39;state&#39; field is the key for using the whole system since the
  interaction between applicants and other individuals is performed by means of
  &#39;actions&#39; which change the &#39;state&#39; of the request always following the
  corresponding workflow. The state also determines who can modify the request in every
  moment. For example, once the request is in &#39;submited&#39; state, the applicant
  will not be able to modify the information unless he/she rolls the request back to
  &#39;incomplete&#39; state first.

%p
  As applicant, your goal should be to reach the final state.

          %p
            The most important information in the travel support request form is probably
            the &#39;expenses&#39; section, which describes how are you
            planning to spend the money. You can add as many expenses as needed, specifying
            the amount you are planning to spend on every one using the &#39;estimated
            amount/currency&#39; column. Sometimes you will know the
            exact amount in advance and sometimes you will have to do an estimation.
            Once you get a reply from the Travel Support Program managers, you will see real
            approved amount for every expense in the &#39;approved amount&#39; column. If you
            finally accept the proposal,
            %strong you will only get the approved amount, not the estimated one.
            Keep this in mind.

          %h3 Reimbursement of travel sponsorship

          %p
            When the event is over, you can go to your accepted request and click the &#39;ask for
            reimbursement&#39; button. It will create a new reimbursement, which is quite similar
            to a request but includes more fields and have a slightly different workflow.
            The new reimbursement will be added to
            = link_to "your reimbursements list", reimbursements_path
            at the left menu.

          %p
            The main operation is almost identical to the requests, with fields for describing
            your activities and the amount finally spent and with fields for providing your bank
            information and the expenses receipts. You also need to upload a signed
            version of the reimbursement. That means printing (click on &#39;download printable
            version&#39;), signing with a pen, scanning the result and uploading it (click on
            &#39;attach signed document&#39;). If you already did it but your reimbursement was
            rolled back and you are performing a second submission, make sure to update the
            signed file to fit the current information in the application.

          %p
            The full workflow for a reimbursement is displayed below. The last states correspond to
            administrative steps related to the payment.

          %h3 Shipment requests

          %p
            Only some events are eligible for merchandising shipment and the type
            of shipment (for example &#39;small booth box&#39;) is set in advance
            for every event. As a consequence, the shipment request form only
            contains contact information and a field for additional notes.
            The full workflow for a shipment request is displayed below.
