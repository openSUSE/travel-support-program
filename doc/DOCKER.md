# Using Docker to Develop TSP

This repository includes a `Dockerfile` and a set of `docker-compose` configuration examples in
order to simplify the process of setting up a development environment.

Given that you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed, the process should be pretty
straighforward.

1. Select a `docker-compose` configuration file from the `docker/` directory and copy it as
   `docker-compose.yml`. For instance, to run the application using a PostgreSQL database:

        cp docker/docker-compose.postgresql docker-compose.yml

2. Uncomment the gem for your favorite database driver from the `Gemfile`.
3. Copy the database configuration from `docker/` for your database. For instance,
   to use PostgreSQL:

        cp docker/database.postgresql.yml config/database.yml

3. Build the image:

        docker-compose build

4. Now you should be able to set up the database:

        docker-compose run --rm web rake db:setup

5. (Optional) Run the testsuite to find out whether the application works.

        docker-compose run --rm web rake spec

6. And, now, you can start the application:

        docker-compose up

For now on, you will need to rebuild the image whenever you change the `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock`
files.
